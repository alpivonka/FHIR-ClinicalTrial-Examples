In some cases, the comparison between the indicated answer and the specified value may differ only by precision.  For example, the enableWhen might be Q1 > 1970, but the answer to Q1 is 1970-10-15.  There is not a clear answer as to whether 1970-10-15 should be considered 'greater' than 1970, given that it is an imprecise value.  In these indeterminate situations, the form filler has the option of refusing to render the form.  If the form **is** displayed, items where enableWhen is indeterminate SHOULD be treated as enabled with a warning indicating that the questionnaire logic was faulty and it is possible that the item should not be enabled.
