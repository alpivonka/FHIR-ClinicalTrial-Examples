    <p><span>The designer of an SoA needs a way to reference and associate specific activities to Epochs defined at the ResearchStudy level. 
        <br>The designer of an SoA will establish a relationship from the SoA to an Activity with the use of PlanDefintion's actions. 
        In order to associate a specific action/Activity with a study-defined Epoch a new extension is introduced at the SoA.action/PlanDefintion 
        to capture the URI to the specific Epoch in question.</br></span></p>
